Project Title: My Sales Data Analyzer & Inventory App
Hello, and welcome to my project!
This is a personal project I built to showcase my skills in Python, data analysis, and web application development. The idea was to create a tool that a small business owner could actually use to track their sales and manage their inventory.

What the App Does
The project is a fully-functional, interactive web dashboard that handles everything from sales tracking to data visualization.

A Clean, Organized App: I used Streamlit to build a beautiful web app in pure Python. The entire app is on a single page, with two easy-to-use tabs to keep things organized.

Real-time Insights: The "Sales Dashboard" gives a quick view of key numbers like Total Revenue and Total Profit. The filters on the side let me explore sales trends and product performance over any date range.

Interactive Charts: I moved beyond static charts and used Plotly to create an interactive bar chart. You can hover over any bar to see the exact number of sales for each product.

Smart Inventory Management: The "Inventory Management" tab is the core of the business logic. It lets me:

Add Sales: When a sale is added, the app automatically checks if there's enough stock and updates the inventory count. It even displays a warning if an item is out of stock.

Add to Stock: I can add new inventory (e.g., a new shipment of pens) and set the cost, which helps track profit.

See Profit/Loss: The app calculates the profit for each transaction, which is a key business metric.

The Technology Behind It: All the data is stored in a lightweight SQLite database, and I used Pandas to handle all the data analysis and calculations.

This project was a great journey into building a complete, end-to-end application. It was a challenge to connect all the pieces, but I'm really proud of the final result.
